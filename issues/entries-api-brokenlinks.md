While crawling [File and Directory Entries API](https://wicg.github.io/entries-api/), the following links to other specifications were detected as pointing to non-existing anchors, which should be fixed:
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#file-upload-state-(type=file)
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#concept-input-type-file-selected
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#drag-data-store
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#drag-data-store-item-list
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#concept-dnd-rw
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#concept-dnd-ro
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#the-drag-data-item-kind
