While crawling [WebCodecs](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/), the following enum values were found to ignore naming conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words):
* [ ] The value `"I420"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I420P10"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I420P12"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I420A"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I420AP10"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I420AP12"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I422"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I422P10"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I422P12"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I422A"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I422AP10"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I422AP12"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I444"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I444P10"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I444P12"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I444A"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I444AP10"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"I444AP12"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"NV12"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"RGBA"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"RGBX"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
* [ ] The value `"BGRA"` of the enum `VideoPixelFormat` does not match the expected conventions (lower case, hyphen separated words)
