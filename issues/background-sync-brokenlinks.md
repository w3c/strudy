Title: Broken references in Web Background Synchronization
---

While crawling [Web Background Synchronization](https://wicg.github.io/background-sync/spec/), the following links to other specifications were detected as pointing to non-existing anchors, which should be fixed:
* [ ] https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/#permission-model
* [ ] https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/index.html#service-worker-registration-interface
* [ ] https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/index.html#service-worker-global-scope-interface
* [ ] https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/index.html#extendable-event-interface
* [ ] https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/index.html#dfn-extend-lifetime-promises
