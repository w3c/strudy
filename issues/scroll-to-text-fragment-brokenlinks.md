Title: Broken references in Text Fragments

---

While crawling [Text Fragments](https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/), the following links to other specifications were detected as pointing to non-existing anchors, which should be fixed:
* [ ] https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-fetch-metadata/#request-user-activation-flag
* [ ] https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/document-policy.html#algo-get-policy-value
* [ ] https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/document-policy.html#configuration-point
* [ ] https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/document-policy.html#configuration-point-type
* [ ] https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/document-policy.html#configuration-point-default-value
