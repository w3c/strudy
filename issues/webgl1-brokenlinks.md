While crawling [WebGL Specification](https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/), the following links to other specifications were detected as pointing to non-existing anchors, which should be fixed:
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#imagebitmap
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#imagebitmapoptions
