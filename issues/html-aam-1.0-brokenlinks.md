While crawling [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0](https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/), the following links to other specifications were detected as pointing to non-existing anchors, which should be fixed:
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#attr-param-name
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/microdata.html#attr-itemprop
* [ ] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#sectioning-root
