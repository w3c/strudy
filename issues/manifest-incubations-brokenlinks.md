* [ ] https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/#valid-suffix-code-points
* [ ] https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#dfn-display-modes-values
* [ ] https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#dfn-display-mode
* [ ] https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#dfn-object
* [ ] https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#dfn-processing-extension-point-of-web-manifest
