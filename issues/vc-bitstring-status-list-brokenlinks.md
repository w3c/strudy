While crawling [Bitstring Status List v1.1](https://w3c.github.io/vc-bitstring-status-list/), the following links to other specifications were detected as pointing to non-existing anchors:
* [ ] https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/#multibase-0

Link should probably target the `cid-1.0` spec instead:
